# Exercise

You work in an international office and regularly have to call clients abroad. The jet-lag makes your job significantly harder as you never know the time at a client location. Hopefully, Paul one of your colleague is a former programmer and he developed a python command line tool to know the time of the day in a given city. However, Paul quit his programming job because he was a messy programmer and by opening the program file you directly notice it. Paul is not following any convention and the output printed for the user is absolutely terrible... The only documentation that Paul sent you by mail is the following: run the code as follow `python main.py CITY`

1.1 Find and fix the program to avoid printing all city informations
1.2 Write a `docstring` documentation for each function
1.3 Smartly use `argparse` to obtain an understandable command line interface
